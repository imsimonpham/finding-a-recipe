> Have you ever opened your fridge and have no idea what to cook for supper tonight? Or maybe you have spent 30 minutes discussing with your partner how you should cook the chicken for your anniversary dinner? This is why I came up with Recipelab - a web application that can suggest many recipes based on user input ingredients. It also notifies users if the recipe is vegan or if it contains milk or gluten. API data is fetched using a custom Hook and the states are managed using Redux-Toolkit.
